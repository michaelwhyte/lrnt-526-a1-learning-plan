# LRNT 526 Assignment 1 - Draft 08 - ChatGPT - Pass 1

*Prompt:* Are you able to look at some text written in Markdown for a university assignment. The assignment is to present a learning plan for an upcoming full paper on a subject related to education and technology...I am ok with the current draft, but the length is about 1250 words or about 200 words too many...Are you able to take a look and perhaps suggest some ways to get down to closer to 1000 words total...

**Response:**

Of course! Please provide the text of your Markdown draft, and I will suggest ways to reduce the word count while maintaining the essential content of your learning plan.

**Note:** This initial pass came up a bit short...Word count was reduced drastically from 1246 words (approximately) down to 524 words...This required a change of strategy...which was to ask ChatGPT to look at what I felt was a couple of my more wordy sections and see if the AI could revise it down to fewer words

## Overview

For the final critical inquiry paper, I plan to write about AI and its effect on assessment. Our group decided on AI as a general topic due to its current uptick in use in mainstream society with the release of LLMs such as ChatGPT. Our group will focus on AI's effect on education in terms of equity and accessibility, and its impact on workplace training and assessment. We chose the OECD virtual conference titled “International Conference on AI in Work, Innovation, Productivity and Skills” (AI WIPS) (OECD, 2023) as the basis for our research.

My paper will focus on student assessment and how AI will change how educators assess learning. With AI-powered LLMs capable of producing average to good quality essays and passing various exams (Zeisloft, 2023), I will research alternative methods of evaluating student knowledge, such as authentic assessments, adaptive assessments, or formative assessment techniques.

## Learning Theory and Course Design Framework

I believe current AI technology necessitates rethinking traditional assessments. I have chosen Constructivism as the learning theory, which posits that people build their knowledge through experiences with others and that learning can be a social experience (Western Governors University, 2020). For a course design framework, I have decided on authentic assessment, which requires students to apply knowledge and skills to real-world issues or problems (Messier, 2022). Demonstrations of learning in the real world give students ways to learn, apply, and demonstrate their achievement of learning outcomes that would be difficult to automate with AI.

## Research Literature

Below are a few articles relating to constructivism and authentic assessment, which will serve as a starting point for further reading:

## Non-Academic Resources on AI and Education

Some reliance on recent blogs, videos, and other non-academic resources will also be used, as AI LLMs are a recent phenomenon. Here are three articles to start with:

## Appling Previous Learning in MALAT to this Research

Three introductory courses from MALAT will be helpful in analyzing the topic of AI and assessment critically. LRNT-522 provided insights into how knowledge is formed and can be applied to learners and assessment design. LRNT-524 taught us to examine the relationship between education and technology and how it affects students' learning and educators' teaching methods. This course also introduced the importance of course design frameworks like Universal Design for Learning (UDL), which aligns with some aspects of authentic assessment. LRNT-526 provided a general understanding of how technology is entangled with pedagogy, which will be useful for analyzing how AI affects assessment design.

## Research Log

I will use markdown files to log reading notes, concept ideas, resources, and other information related to developing a final paper on AI and assessment. These can be found at this URL:

## Summary

Selwyn (2010) encourages educational researchers to look at technology not just in terms of its future potential but its effect on everyday life today. My goal with this paper is to understand how AI is affecting assessments so that effective ways can be developed for future course and assessment designs, allowing students to utilize AI to enhance productivity, but not as a crutch to give the appearance of learning.
