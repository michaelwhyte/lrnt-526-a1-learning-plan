# LRNT 526 Assignment 1 - Draft 07 - Michael	
## Overview
			
For the final critical inquiry paper, I plan to write about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its effect on assessment. Our group decided on AI as a general topic due to its current uptick in use in mainstream society due to the release of LLMs (large language models) such as ChatGPT. These new AIs are publicly accessible, free to low-cost, and relatively easy to use for the average person. Our group will, as a whole, look at AI's effect on education regarding equity and accessibility and their impact on workplace training and assessment. The group chose the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) virtual conference titled “International Conference on AI in Work, Innovation, Productivity and Skills” (AI WIPS) (OECD, 2023). The conference, held in March of 2023, focused on AI's current and future effects in the workplace, education, and society. Although the conference looked at AI from the workplace, culture, and education lens, many of the general issues discussed (disruption and changes to work, privacy, and future skills) can also be applied to the classroom. These changes caused by AI in how people work and what skills they will need will determine what and how we teach and how students achieve and demonstrate knowledge.

While our group will focus on three areas of AI and education (equity, workplace training, and assessment), my paper will focus on student assessment and how AI will change how educators assess learning. AI-powered Large Language Models (LLM) allow essays of average to good quality to be produced by simply entering a short prompt (Keith, 2023), and can pass medical, bar, and MBA exams (Zeisloft, 2023); this leads me to research to determine if it is worthwhile to consider alternative methods of evaluating student knowledge, such as authentic assessments, adaptive assessments, or formative assessment techniques. These forms of assessments might allow students to demonstrate their knowledge that would be difficult to have an AI do for them while also allowing them to learn in a less structured way. For the program I teach in, we rely heavily on more authentic real-world assessments currently, but even so, with the program's subject matter of web development, producing large chunks of code can be easily achieved through natural language prompts with modern LLMs, allowing a student to appear to understand learning objectives, but in reality not to. This will require instructors in our program to develop other means beyond having students produce applications that AIs can easily create.
 
## Learning Theory and Course Design Framework

I believe that the abilities of current AI technology will require a rethinking of traditional assessments. This belief has brought me to a learning theory and a course design framework. The learning theory and framework I have chosen deal with learning in the real world instead of the virtual or digital domain. For the learning theory, I have landed on Constructivism. AI thrives in the virtual space; it is excellent at generating digital content, which can make some traditional assessments less effective. Parts of constructivism, in comparison, posit that people build their knowledge through experiences with other people and that learning can be a social experience (Western Governors University, 2020). These social interactions, such as group work and class discussions, can be complex for an AI to replicate and could help ensure students can demonstrate an understanding of and synthesize information rather than simply reproducing or re-wording existing knowledge.  

For a course design framework, I have decided on authentic assessment. Similar to aspects of social learning from constructivism, authentic assessment requires students to apply knowledge and skills to real-world issues or problems (Messier, 2022). One aspect of authentic assessment is a demonstration of learning. This requires students to showcase their knowledge in non-traditional ways beyond the essay, such as with a presentation, a video, or a class lecture (Messier, 2022). These demonstrations of knowledge in the real world give students ways to learn, apply and demonstrate their achievement of learning outcomes that would be difficult to automate with an AI currently. 

## Research Literature

The brief descriptions in the previous sections regarding constructivism and authentic assessment scratch the surface of my understanding of those theories/frameworks. Additional reading will be required to understand them in-depth to apply them to the current situation around AI and learning assessment.

Below are a few articles relating to constructivism and authentic assessment. This is just a start; reading beyond these articles will be necessary.

## Appling Previous learning in MALAT to this Research

All courses at MALAT have played a part in my understanding of the relationship between education and technology. With that, three introductory courses from MALAT will be helpful in my ability to analyze the topic of AI and assessment critically. The first of these three, LRNT-522, dealt with the foundation of research and how knowledge is created. Readings from this course, such as Johnson and Christensen's (2013) *Educational Research: Quantitative, Qualitative, and Mixed Approaches*, chapter 1, 'Introduction to Educational Research' helped to understand how knowledge is formed, which in this case related to how knowledge is gained through research, but this can also be applied to learners in general and can help educators design assessments that allow students to gather, understand and critically analyze information. The next course, LRNT-524, taught us to examine the relationship between education and technology and how technology affects how students learn and educators teach. Similar concepts were presented by Irwin (2023, 22:18) in LRNT-526 with his slide outlining technology's relationship with pedagogy. AI is just the latest education technology that has appeared throughout history. Understanding in general terms how technology is entangled with pedagogy will help analyze how AI will affect how assessments are designed going forward. Lastly, LRNT-524 introduced the importance of course design frameworks, which give an instructional designer a structure backed by academic research on planning a course that will enable learners to learn. For LRNT-524, I focused on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) which provides methods that allow learners of all abilities access to knowledge. UDL encourages instructional designers to create lessons and assessments that will enable students to demonstrate knowledge in non-traditional mediums such as presentations, videos, websites, and other mediums (UDL: Expression & Communication, 2018); this aligns with some aspects of authentic assessment, which encourages the development of alternative assessments that reflect real-world scenarios.

## Research Log

As a web developer, I prefer to write in markdown (HTML shorthand) and version control content using GitHub. Consequently, I will use markdown files to log reading notes, concept ideas, resources and other information related to developing a final paper on AI and assessment. These can be found at this URL:

## Summary

Understanding how technology such as AI affects society here and now is essential. Selwyn (2010) encourages educational researchers to look at technology not just regarding its future potential but how it will affect everyday life today. My hope with this forthcoming paper is to discover an understanding of how AI is affecting assessments so that for future course and assessment designs, effective ways can be developed that will allow students to utilize AI to enhance productivity, but not just to use it as a crutch to give the appearance of learning.
