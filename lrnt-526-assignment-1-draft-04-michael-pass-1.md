# LRNT 526 Assignment 1 - Draft 04 - Michael - Pass 1	
## Overview
			
For the final critical inquiry paper I plan to write about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its effect on assessment. Our group decided on AI as a general topic due to its current uptick in use in mainstream society due to the release of LLMs (large language models) such as ChatGPT. These new AIs are publicly accessible, free to low-cost and can be relatively easy-to-use for the average person. Our group will as a whole will be looking at AIs effect on education in regards to equity and accessibility, its effect on the workplace training, and assessment. The group chose the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) virtual conference titled “International Conference on AI in Work, Innovation, Productivity and Skills,” (AI WIPS) (OECD, 2023). The conference, held in March of 2023 focused on the current and future effects of AI in the workplace, education, and society. Although the conference looked at AI from the lens of the workplace, society at large and education, many of the general issued discussed at the conference (distruption and changes to work, privacy, and future skills) [CITE - OECD Conference] can also be applied to the classroom. These changes caused by AI in how people work, and what skills they will need, will determine what we and how we teach, and how students achieve and demonstrate knowledge.

While our group will focus on three areas of AI and education (equity, workplace training, and assessement), for my individual paper I will be focusing on student assessment and how AI will change how educators assess learning. AI powered Large Language Models (LLM) allow essays of average to good quality to be produced by simply entering a short prompt [CITE - <https://academictech.uchicago.edu/2023/02/07/combating-academic-dishonesty-part-7-authentic-assessments-and-the-challenge-of-ai/>], and can pass medical, bar, and MBA exams [CITE - <https://www.dailywire.com/news/chatgpt-passes-medical-license-exam-bar-exam-after-top-performance-on-wharton-mba-final>], this leads me to answer the question if it might be worthwhile to explore alternative methods of evaluating student knowledge, such as authentic assessments, adaptive assessments, or formative assessment techniques. These forms of assessments might give students the ability to demonstrate their knowledge that would be difficult to have an AI do for them, while also allowing them to learn in a less structured way. For the program I teach in, we rely heavily on more authentic real world assessments currently, but even so, with the program's subject matter of web development, producing large chunks of code can be easily achieved through natural language prompts with modern LLMs, allowing a student to appear to understand learning objectives, but in reality not to. This will require instructors in our program to come with other means beyond having students produce applications which can be easily produced by AIs.  
	
## Learning Theory and Course Design Framework

I believe that the abilities of current AI technology will require a rethinking of traditional assessments. This belief has brought me to one learning theory and one course design framework. Both the learning theory and framework I have chosen have aspects that deal with learning in the real world as opposed to the virtual or digital domain. For the learning theory I have landed on Constructivism. AI thrives in the virtual space, it is great at generating digital content, which can make some traditional assessments less effective. Parts of constructivism, in comparison, possits that people build their knowledge through experiences with other people, and that learning can be a social experience [CITE: <https://www.wgu.edu/blog/what-constructivism2005.html#close>]. These social interactions such as group work, and class discussions can be difficult for an AI to replicate and could help ensure students have the ability to demonstrate an understanding of and be able synthesize information rather than simply reproducing or re-wording exsisting knowledge.  

For a course design framework, I have decided on authentic assessment. Similar to aspects of social learning from constructivisim, authentic assessment requires students to apply knowledge and skills to real world issues or problems [CITE - <https://teaching.uic.edu/resources/teaching-guides/assessment-grading-practices/authentic-assessments/>]. One aspect of authentic assessment is demonstration of learning. This requires students to showcase their knowledge in non-traditional ways beyond the essay, such as with a presentation, a video, or a class lecture [CITE - <https://teaching.uic.edu/resources/teaching-guides/assessment-grading-practices/authentic-assessments/>]. These demonstrations of knowledge in the real world, give students ways to learn, apply and prove their achievement of learning outcomes that would be difficult to automate with an AI currently. 

## Research Literature

The brief descriptions in the previous sections in regards to constructivism and authentic assessment just scratches the surface of my understanding of those theories/frameworks. Additional reading will be required to understand them in-depth in order to apply them to the current situation happening around AI and learning assessment.

Below are a few article relating to constructivism and authentic assessment. This is just a start, reading beyond these articles will be necessary.

## Non-Academic Resources on AI and Education

While a large portion of academic research will rely on traditional academic articles, since publicly available, and easy to use AI LLMs is a very recent phenomenon, some reliance on more recent blogs, videos and other non-academic resources will also be used. Below are three articles, which represent just a few of the many of I have bookmarked for reading.

## Appling Previous learning in MALAT to this Research

All courses at MALAT have played a part in my understanding of the relationship between education and technology. With that, three prior courses from MALAT will be helpful in my ability to critically analyze the topic of AI and assessment. The first of these three, LRNT-522 dealt with the foundation of research and how knowledge is created. Readings from this course such as Johnson & Christensen (2013) *Educational Research: Quantitative, Qualitative, and Mixed Approaches* helped to understand how knowledge is formed, which in this case related to how knowledge is gained through research, but this can also be applied to learners in general and can help educators design assessments that allow students to gather, understand and critically analyze information. The next course, LRNT-524 taught us to take deep look at the relationship between education and technology. How technology affects both how students learn and educators teach. Similar concepts were presented by Irwin (2023) in LRNT-526 with his slide outlining technology's relationship with pedagogy. AI is just the latest of education technologies that have appeared throughout history. Understanding in general terms how technology is entangled with pedagodgy will help with analyzing how AI will effect the way assessments are designed going forward. Lastly LRNT-524, introduced importance of course design frameworks, which give an instructional designer a structure backed by academic research of how to plan a course that will enable learners to learn. For LRNT-524 I focused on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) which provides methods that allow learners of all abilities access to knowledge. UDL encourages instructional designers to create lessons and assessments that allow students to demonstrate knowledge in non-traditional mediums such as presentations, videos, and other mediums (Cast, 2023), this aligns with some aspects of authentic assessment which encourages development of alternative assessments that reflect real world scenarios.

## Research Log

As a web developer I prefer to write in markdown (HTML shorthand) and version control content using GitHub. Consequently I will be using a markdown files to log reading notes, concept ideas, resources and other information related to developing a final paper on AI and assessment. These can be found at this URL:

## Summary

It is important to understand how technology such as AI effects society in the hear and now. Selwyn (2010) encourages educational researches to look at technology not just in regards to its future potential, but how it will effect everyday life today. My hope with this forthcoming paper is to discover an understanding of how AI is affecting assessments, so that for future course and assessment designs, effective ways can be developed that will allow students to still utilize AI to enhance producitivy, but to not just use it as a crutch to give the appearance of learning.
