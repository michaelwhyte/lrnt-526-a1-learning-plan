## Summative vs. Formative Assessment - ChatGPT

**Prompt:**

Can you explain in simple terms the difference between summative and formative assessments in education?

**Response:**

In simple terms, summative and formative assessments are two types of evaluations used in education to measure students' learning and progress.

1. **Summative assessment:** This type of assessment occurs at the end of a learning period, like a unit, semester, or course. Its main purpose is to evaluate how much a student has learned and whether they achieved the learning goals. Summative assessments are typically high-stakes tests or exams, such as final exams, standardized tests, or end-of-course projects. They provide a snapshot of a student's overall understanding and are used for grading purposes or to determine if a student is ready to move on to the next level.

2. **Formative assessment:** This type of assessment takes place during the learning process and is used to monitor and guide students' learning. The main purpose of formative assessments is to provide feedback to both teachers and students, helping them identify strengths and weaknesses, and adjust instruction accordingly. Examples of formative assessments include quizzes, in-class activities, discussions, or homework assignments. They are low-stakes and typically not used for grading, but rather to support and enhance learning.
In summary, summative assessments evaluate a student's learning at the end of a period, while formative assessments monitor and support learning throughout the process.
