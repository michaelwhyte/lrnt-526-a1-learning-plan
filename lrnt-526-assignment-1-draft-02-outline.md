			- This document will focus on the requirements (what and why of the paper) and the design phases (how)...
			
	- For the final critical inquiry paper I plan to write about AI and its effect on assessment.
	- Our group decided on AI as a general topic due to its current uptick in use in mainstream society due to the release of LLMs (large language models) such as ChatGPT. These new AIs are publicly accessible, free to low-cost and can be relatively easy-to-use for the average person. Our group will as a whole will be looking at AIs effect on education in regards to equity and accessibility, its effect on the workplace training, and assessment. The group chose the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) virtual conference titled “International Conference on AI in Work, Innovation, Productivity and Skills,” (AI WIPS) (OECD, 2023). The conference, held in March of 2023 focused on the current and future effects of AI in the workplace, education, and society. 
	- Although the conference looked at AI from the lens of the workplace, society at large and education, many of the general issued discussed at the conference (distruption and changes to work, privacy, and future skills) [CITE - OECD Conference] can be applied to the classroom. These changes in how people work, and what skills they will need, will determine what we teach, how we teach, and how students achieve and demonstrate knowledge.
	- While our group will focus on three areas of AI and education (equity, workplace training, and assessement), for my individual paper I will be focusing on student assessment and how AI will change or at the very least should change how educators assess learning and allow students to demonstrate their knowledge. LLMs allow essays of average to good quality essays to be produced by simply entering a short prompt [CITE - <https://academictech.uchicago.edu/2023/02/07/combating-academic-dishonesty-part-7-authentic-assessments-and-the-challenge-of-ai/>], they can provide answers to test questions with relative ease [CITATION NEEDED] and can pass medical, bar, and other structured exams [CITATION NEEDED], which leads me to hypothesize that it might be worthwhile to explore alternative methods of evaluating student knowledge, such as authentic assessments, adaptive assessments, or formative assessment techniques. These forms of assessments might give students the ability to demonstrate their knowledge that would be difficult to have an AI do for them, while also allowing them to learn in a less structured way.
	
For the program I teach in, we rely heavily on more authentic real world assessments currently, but even so, with my subject matter of web development, producing large chunks of code can be easily achieved through natural language prompts with modern LLMs, allowing a student to appear to understand learning objectives, but in reality not to. This will require instructors in our program to come with other means beyond have students produce applications which can be produced by AIs with relative ease.

	- Introduce topic
		- Assessment in an AI powered world
		- Why this topic and how it relates to our team project

	- List out literature that discusses the chosen literature
	- List out other articles and blogs you have so far that relate to AI and education
	
**Learning Theory and Course Design Framework**

- Since at this early stage of my research into AI and eductaion I believe that the abilities of current AI technology will require a rethinking of traditional assessments. This has pushed in the direction of one learning theory and one course design framework, both of which have aspects that deal with learning in the real world as opposed to the virtual or digital domain. For the learning theory I have landed on Constructivism. AI thrives in the virtual space, it is great at generating digital content, which can make some traditional assessments less effective. Parts of constructivism, in comparison possits that people build their knowledge through experiences with other people, and that learn can be a social experience [CITE: <https://www.wgu.edu/blog/what-constructivism2005.html#close>]. These social interactions such as group work, and class discussions can be difficult for an AI to replicate and will help ensure students can demonstrate an understanding and synthesis of information rather than simply reproducing or re-wording exsisting knowledge.  

For a course design framework, I have decided on authentic assessment. Similar to aspects of social learning from constructivisim, authentic assessment requires students to apply knowledge and skills to real world issues or problems [CITE - <https://teaching.uic.edu/resources/teaching-guides/assessment-grading-practices/authentic-assessments/>]. One aspect of authentic assessment is demonstration of learning. This requires students to showcase their knowledge in non-traditional ways beyond the essay, such as with a presentation, a video, or a class lecture [CITE - <https://teaching.uic.edu/resources/teaching-guides/assessment-grading-practices/authentic-assessments/>]. These demonstrations of knowledge in the real world, give students ways to learn, apply and prove their achievement of learning outcomes that would be difficult to automate with an AI. 

**Paragraph 7**

**Literature:**

The brief descriptions in the previous sections in regards to constructivism and authentic assessment just scratches the surface of understanding of those theories/frameworks. Additional reading will be required to understand them in-depth in order to apply them to the current situation happening around AI and learning assessment.

Below are a few article relating to constructivism and authentic assessment. This is just a start, reading beyond these articles will be necessary.

**Paragraph 8**

- Previous learning in MALAT...

All courses at MALAT have played a part in my understanding of the relationship between education and technology. With that, three prior courses from MALAT will be helpful in my ability to critically analyze the topic of AI and assessment. The first of these three, LRNT-522 dealt with the foundation of research and how knowledge is created. Readings from this course such as Johnson & Christensen (2013) *Educational Research: Quantitative, Qualitative, and Mixed Approaches* helped to understand how knowledge is formed, which in this case related to knowledge gained through research, but this can also be applied to learners in general and can help educators design assessments that allow students to gather, understand and critically analyze information. The next course, LRNT-524 taught us to take deep look at the relationship between education and technology. How technology affects both how students learn and educators teach. Similar concepts were presented by Irwin (2023) in LRNT-526 with his slide outlining technolog's relationship with pedagogy. AI is just the latest of education technologies that have appeared throughout history. Understanding in general terms how technology is entangled with pedagodgy will help with analyzing how AI will effect the way assessments are designed going forward. Lastly LRNT-524, introduced importance of course design frameworks, which give you a structure backed by academic research of how to plan a course that will enable learners to learn. For this course I focused on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) which provides methods that allow learners of all abilities access to knowledge. UDL encourages course designers to allow students to demonstrate knowledge in non-traditional mediums such as presentations, videos, and other mediums (Cast, 2023), this aligns with some aspects of authentic assessment which encourages development of alternative assessments that reflect real world scenarios.

## Research Log

As a web developer I prefer to write in markdown (HTML shorthand) and version control content using GitHub. Consequently I will be using a markdown files to log reading notes, concept ideas, resources and other information related to developing a final paper on AI and assessment. These can be found at this URL:

- <https://github.com/michaelwhyte/lrnt-526-a1-research-log>

## Summary

It is important to understand how technology such as AI effects society in the hear and now. Selwyn (2010) encourages educational researches to look at technology not just in regards to its future potential, but how it will effect everyday life in the here and now. My hope with this forthcoming paper is to discover a deep understanding of how AI is affecting assessments today, so that for future course and assessment designs, effective ways can be developed that will allow students to still utilize AI to aid in critically analysing knowledge, and not just as a crutch to give the appearance of learning.

## AI Prompts to help with Writing

### ChatGPT - April 22, 2023

**Prompt:** I am trying to say this...but I can't quite get the words together...basically what I am trying to say is that with LLMs like ChatGPT being able to easily pass standardized tests such as medical, bar, and other similar exams it might be time to look at alternative ways to assess students knowledge on a topic...such as authentic assessmen, adaptive assements or more formative forms of assessment...

**Response:** 

I understand what you're trying to convey. It seems you want to express that given the proficiency of large language models like ChatGPT in passing standardized tests, including medical, bar, and other professional exams, it might be worthwhile to explore alternative methods of evaluating student knowledge, such as authentic assessments, adaptive assessments, or formative assessment techniques.

**Prompt:**

Can you define authentic assessment from an education perspective

**Response:**

Authentic assessment, from an education perspective, refers to the process of evaluating students' skills, knowledge, and abilities through tasks that closely resemble real-world situations and challenges. The primary aim of authentic assessment is to measure students' ability to apply their learning in practical, meaningful contexts rather than simply recalling facts or demonstrating isolated skills.

Authentic assessments often include activities such as:

1. Problem-solving tasks: Students are required to analyze complex, real-world problems and develop solutions.

2. Project-based learning: Students collaborate to complete a project, typically involving research, planning, and execution.

3. Performance assessments: Students demonstrate their skills or knowledge through activities like presentations, debates, or role-playing scenarios.

4. Portfolios: Students compile a collection of their work over time, showcasing growth, development, and mastery of skills.

By using authentic assessments, educators can gain a deeper understanding of students' competencies and growth, while students become more engaged in their learning and better prepared for real-world situations.

**Prompt:**

Do you any learning theory that would go well with authentic assessment

**Response:**

Yes, one learning theory that aligns well with authentic assessment is Constructivism. Constructivism is a learning theory that posits that knowledge is actively constructed by learners as they engage with and make sense of the world around them. It emphasizes the importance of context, social interaction, and personal experiences in the learning process.

Constructivist principles align well with authentic assessment for several reasons:

1. Emphasis on active learning: Both constructivism and authentic assessment focus on active learning, where students are encouraged to apply their knowledge and skills to real-world situations. This helps learners develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

2. Learner-centered approach: Constructivism emphasizes the role of the learner in constructing knowledge, while authentic assessment focuses on tasks that are relevant and meaningful to the learner. This learner-centered approach supports the idea that learning is most effective when students are engaged and motivated.

3. Collaboration and social interaction: Constructivism highlights the importance of social interactions in learning, as learners co-construct knowledge through dialogue and collaboration. Authentic assessments often involve collaborative activities like group projects or peer evaluations, which can facilitate social learning and knowledge construction.

4. Integration of knowledge and skills: Both constructivism and authentic assessment focus on integrating knowledge and skills across disciplines, rather than teaching them in isolation. Authentic assessments often require students to apply knowledge from multiple subject areas to solve real-world problems.

5. Reflection and metacognition: Constructivism encourages learners to reflect on their learning experiences and develop metacognitive skills. Authentic assessments, like portfolios or performance assessments, can provide opportunities for students to reflect on their progress and growth, fostering self-awareness and self-regulation.

By incorporating constructivist principles into the design and implementation of authentic assessments, educators can create learning environments that support meaningful, engaged, and lasting learning experiences for students.




I found an article that might be helpful for you. According to a good practice guide on designing assessment for Artificial Intelligence (AI), authentic assessment requires students “to perform real-world tasks to demonstrate meaningful application of essential knowledge and skills… [and are like] those tasks that are encountered in the real-life workplace, where individuals are free to use various reference resources, consult with experts and take guidance from supervisors”¹. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
